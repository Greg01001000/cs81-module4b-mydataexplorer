### CS 81 Module 4B: My Personal Data Objects, by GregH, 7/8/25

#### Were your predictions right?

My screentime prediction was right. My 'best focus day' prediction was wrong; Thursday and Saturday are tied for best focus. My 'caffeine helping focus' prediction appears to be wrong, but that could be because I don't drink caffeine on days that I am already highly focused. Or it could be because I made up the data.

#### What surprised you?

It surprised me that we were supposed to find a correlation (between caffeine and focus). Fortunately for me, I took CS 82A & 82B before.

#### What was tricky or rewarding?

Understanding how to work with property-value pair objects, and arrays of such objects, is tricky. Figuring out what parameters to pass to functions can be tricky. Getting all the code working was rewarding.

#### How did using your own data change things?
I didn't like it, because I often don't like sharing personal information with people outside my family. And I didn't like having to make up my data (even while trying to make it realistic), because I don't like being inaccurate, but I didn't have time to keep track of my time, moods, caffeine intake, and focus for a week. Besides, I often don't even know whether I'm in a good mood or not.
