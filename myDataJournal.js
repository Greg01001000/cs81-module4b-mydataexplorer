// PREDICTIONS: I predict that the most screentime will be on either Wednesday 
// or Friday because I usually have fewer issues requiring my attention late in
// the week, aside from a weekly Thursday meeting, and I tend to be caught up
// on sleep late in the week.
// I predict that my best focus day is Sunday because I am motivated by 
// classwork deadlines.
// I don't ingest much caffeine, but sometimes in the afternoon I get sleepy
// and my productivity drops. If I try to power through without caffeine, I 
// usually fall asleep while sitting up. So usually as soon as I notice that
// I'm getting sleepy, I get a cup of strong, black tea, which usually wakes me
// up and restores my productivity. So I believe my limited intake helps, even
// if it might not correlate with overall higher-focus or better-mood days in
// my made-up data. But since you asked, I'll just say, sure, I think caffeine
// is helping.
